While developing the **"Quem sou eu?"** (Who Am I?) game app using **React Native** with **Expo**, I ran into a tricky issue: loading images dynamically from local assets based on category data stored in JSON files.

This article breaks down the problem, my investigation, and the clean solution I implemented using `expo-asset`.

## 🐛 The Problem

### 🔧 Project Context

In the game, there's a **Category List** screen that displays each game category as a card, including an title, background color, and **an image**.

My goal was to keep category definitions in a JSON file and dynamically load images based on the `image` property of each category.

```json
{
  "key": "animals",
  "name": "Animals",
  "background": "#FFB6C1",
  "image": "animals",
  "items": []
}
```

### ⚠️ Expected Behavior

Each category card should display the corresponding image by reading its path from the JSON:

```tsx
<Image source={require(category.image)} />
```

### ❌ Actual Behavior

This approach failed with the following error:

```bash
ERROR app/index.tsx:Invalid call: require(category.image)
```

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Investigation

After some digging, I realized that:

- `require()` must use **static strings**.
- It cannot resolve **dynamic paths** at runtime.
- This is due to how **Metro bundler** works in React Native: it needs to bundle all assets **at build time**.

### 🔍 Hypothesis

> “The problem happens because `require()` cannot resolve dynamic paths like `require(category.image)`.”

### 🧪 Tried Solution

I explored [Expo's Asset Management system](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/assets) and found a more flexible way to map local assets without hardcoding them.

## 💡 The Solution

Here’s how I solved the issue using `expo-asset`:

### ✅ 1. Installed the required package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-asset
```

I used version `~11.1.5` during implementation, but you should install the most recent version available when following along.

### ✅ 2. Updated `app.config.js` or `app.config.ts`

```ts
export default {
  ...
  plugins: [
    [
      "expo-asset",
      {
        assets: ["./assets/images/modules/animals.png"],
      },
    ],
    ...
  ]
};
```

### ✅ 3. Adjusted JSON structure

```json
{
  "key": "animals",
  "name": "Animals",
  "background": "#FFB6C1",
  "image": "animals"
}
```

Then, in the component:

```diff-tsx
{categories.map((category) => (
    <CategoryItem
      key={category.key}
      onPress={handlePress}
    >
      <Image
-       source={require(category.image)}
+       source={{ uri: category.image }}
        style={{ width: 70, height: 70 }}
      />
      <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{category.name}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  ));
}
```

### ✅ 5. Rebuild the development build

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

Or using EAS:

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

- `require()` is **not dynamic** — it must use static strings because the Metro bundler needs to preload all assets.
- When working with JSON-driven data that refers to local assets, we need to **manually map those assets** and reference them statically.
- The **expo-asset plugin** helps Expo identify and package assets when they’re declared explicitly.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This problem taught me how static asset bundling really works under the hood in Expo. Though I expected dynamic paths to “just work”, React Native’s static bundling model required a workaround.

If you're loading local images based on dynamic data, especially from a JSON file, this pattern with an image map and `require()` is the way to go.

Let me know if you’ve faced a similar issue — I’d love to hear your solution!
