Everything started with a casual game of Tetris. Interrupted by ads, I realized how far modern versions strayed from the original Brick Game charm. That moment sparked an idea: to build a clean, modern, **ad-free** version of the Brick Game using React Native — both as a tribute to retro gaming and a way to strengthen my frontend skills.

## 🎮 The Classic Inspiration

I grew up playing those "9999-in-1" handheld minigames with my siblings — racing games, tanks, snake, and of course, Tetris. These simple pixel games sparked my early passion for design and tech.

  }}
/>

## 🧱 Why React Native?

React Native was the perfect playground:

- Cross-platform (Android + iOS)
- Pixel grid rendering via custom game loop
- Scalable architecture with **Clean Code principles**
- Built with **Expo**, **Zustand**, and **Expo Router**

I applied atomic design and isolated each game engine for modular expansion.

  }}
/>

## 🕹️ Games Included

So far, I’ve implemented:

- 🟪 **Tetris**
- 🐍 **Snake**
- 🏓 **Pong** (with CPU AI and vertical layout)

Each game is built with its own engine and logic, rendered over a shared pixel-based grid.

    borderColor: "#a1a1a1",
    padding: 10,
  }}
/>

## 📲 Designed for Mobile

Despite being pixelated, the game adapts smoothly to any screen size. The layout replicates the original minigame feeling while remaining responsive and touch-friendly.

    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: "#a1a1a1",
    padding: 10,
  }}
/>

## 🎨 Nostalgia Meets Clean UI

I carefully balanced the retro look with modern usability:

- 10x20 grid with authentic matrix look
- Vibrating and audio feedback
- Font inspired by original consoles
- Clean borders and spacing for readability

  style={{
    width: "50%",
    borderRadius: 20,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: "#a1a1a1",
    padding: 10,
  }}
/>

## 🔁 Game Loop & Logic

I created a simple game loop using `setInterval` (Mobile), controlling update rate per game. Each frame, the engine updates state and triggers a re-render of the pixel matrix.

## 🔊 Sound System

I mapped nostalgic SFX like bounce, move, game over, and victory — with constraints to avoid overlapping sounds or rapid spam. All sounds are defined statically and loaded using Expo Audio.

## 🧠 Clean Architecture

Each game lives in a dedicated folder with:

- `useEngine.ts` for core logic
- `useControls.ts` for movement
- `constants.ts` and `types.ts` for maintainability
- Screens and HUDs follow atomic design: atoms → molecules → templates

New games can be plugged in with minimal changes.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Building a pixel engine requires performance awareness
- Game UX needs constant testing across screen sizes
- A clean codebase makes future experiments much easier
- Retro games can still teach us a lot about good design

---

## 🚀 What's Next

Soon, the project will be available on the **Play Store (Beta)**. I also plan to include:

- 🎯 Brick shooter
- 🐤 Tamagotchi-style pet mode
- 🧠 “Pi Challenge” (Tetris based on π digit sequence)
- 🛡️ Tank battle and car racing
- 🧩 Multiplayer and leaderboards

## 📌 Conclusion

This project blends childhood nostalgia with modern tools. Whether you're into retro gaming or just enjoy clean code and clever UI, the Brick Game is a joyful throwback with modern polish.
